This project is the work of Barsolle Hugo and Demassias William developed within the scope of the ‘22_E4FI_4I_IN3 – Développement mobile’ unit. 

We are two students in our fourth year at ESIEE Paris engineering school. We take part in the computer science and applications course.

The project is an application that provides an interface where you can manage your meal planning according to your personal specifications and health goal.
This repository contains the project. 

To set it up and run it on expo, you first need to install an editor on your computer if you haven’t one yet, we recommend the use of vscode https://code.visualstudio.com/download. 

Then, you have to install:
- react-native https://reactnative.dev/docs/environment-setup
- and expo https://docs.expo.dev/. You will also need to install the expo go mobile application to run the app on your phone. 
You have to create an Expo account if you don't already have one.

Ensure your phone is connected to the same WiFi network as your computer. 

When this setup has been completed, you can run the command ‘npx expo start’ on a terminal. 
This will display a QA code that you can scan with your smartphone. 
This will open the expo-go app and you will see the application running.
The first screen displayed should be the Health Goals screen, you can now discover and use the application freely.
